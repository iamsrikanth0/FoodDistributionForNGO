# FoodDistributionForNGO
Many NGOs and charitable organizations collect surplus food from various donors and distribute it to people in need. However, the process is often manual and may not be optimized. We will use data structures and algorithms to optimize the food distribution process, considering factors like perishability, distance, and demand.
Key Components:
Donor and Recipient Database:
- HashMap to store information about food donors and recipients.

Graph Representation for Locations:
A graph to represent locations (donors, distribution centers, recipients) and the distances between them.

Dijkstra's Algorithm for Route Optimization
- Apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between donors, distribution centers, and recipients, considering travel distances and minimizing time.

//Dynamic Programming for Food Perishability:
- Consider dynamic programming to optimize the distribution of perishable goods, ensuring timely delivery to recipients.

//Real-time Updates for Inventory and Demand:
- Implement a system to update the inventory of available food and the real-time demand from recipients.

//User Interface for NGOs:
- Develop a user interface for NGOs to input information about available food, donors, and recipient locations.
- Display optimized routes and distribution plans.

Potential Impact:
- Efficient utilization of surplus food, reducing wastage.
- Timely delivery of food to recipients in need.
- Cost-effective and environmentally friendly distribution

>> Scope for scaling
1. Adding More Features:
Depending on your project's requirements, you may need to add features like considering perishable goods, dynamically updating inventory, handling real-time demand changes, etc.

2. Enhancing Functionality:
You may want to enhance it by incorporating additional factors such as vehicle capacity, time constraints, or cost factors in the optimization process.

3. Modifying for Specific Scenarios:
You should modify this based on the actual locations, distances, and relationships in your specific scenario. For instance, if you have a real dataset of locations and distances, you would replace the sample data with your actual data.

4. Adding User Interaction:
For instance, you might want to add functionalities for users to input donor information, recipient information, and food details.

5. Real-time Updates:
- The current code does not handle real-time updates of inventory or demand. If your project requires real-time updates, you may need to incorporate mechanisms for tracking and updating data dynamically.
